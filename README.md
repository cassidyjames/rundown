# Rundown

## Test your battery life

Rundown runs a suite of tests on your machine simulating some concept of normal usage. Run it until your battery dies, then re-open Rundown to see the stats.

Great for OEMs testing upcoming hardware or end users wondering how their battery should behave under normal circumstances.

## Ideal Flow

1. Wait for battery to be charged (Once charged, copy current power-related settings to GSettings backups?)
2. Instruct user to unplug the power
3. Upon unplugging, inhibit and set standard brightness level
4. Begin test

## Future Test Ideas

- Play a video on repeat
- Load certain web pages
- Compile code
